# GTFS Static Feed for Local Bus Services of Kaposvár City
![Travis CI status](https://travis-ci.org/OPENKaposvar/ktrt-gtfs.svg?branch=develop)

_Read this in another languages: [magyar](README.hu.md)._

With [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) we can generate machine-readable files to describe local public transportation services, such as _routes, schedules, fares_ and so on.

## Purpose of the project

Kaposvár city's only public transportation agency is [Kaposvári Tömegközlekedési Zrt.](http://ktrt.hu). At this moment they does not provide service data in GTFS format.
Our mission is to create a standards-based GTFS feed for online schedules, route planning utilities, GIS analytics, etc.

## Current state

Still warming up - no releases are available yet. You can switch to _devel_ branch to get a sneak peek of how things are going.
_Suggestions, questions are welcome, just open a new issue if you have something to say, or ask!_
